## flow-typed

The definitions under the `npm` folder here are pulled down from
[`flow-typed`](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed). Please do not change these files directly.

## New dependencies

```sh
$ flow-typed install
```

This command will check against the definitions repository and install type defs if they are available, or it will generate `any` typed stubs for modules that do not have definitions.
