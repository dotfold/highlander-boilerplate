## flow-libs

This directory is for internal lib definitions that are common / shared. For example a core component that is used in multiple places throughout the codebase.

`@see <SRCROOT>/.flowconfig`

## New modules

If the module is a 3rd party, check on flow-typed first for definitions.

Before adding common modules, decide if the type definitions are not better suited within a module.

See the flow docs for creating shared / common definitions inside a project.
